# Multiball Library

This library contains code that's used in several hardware projects - the furball, butterball, discoball, waterball, powerball. Splitting it into its own library allows it to be easily reused and allows the projects to be very modular.

See also the Multiball Sensor library, which contains highly uniform and modular sensor code that is also reused among projects.

Unless you're working with one of the "ball" projects you almost certainly don't want to use this.
